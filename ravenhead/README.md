## The Gates of Ravenhead
After the players have decided to make their way to Ravenhead you'll want a couple of battles, I used http://tools.goblinist.com/5enc to generate 2 encounters, 1 in the plains and 1 in the mountains, separate them by a little bit, or skip them, or generate/plan your own.

### Encounter 1 700XP (117XP)
Creature List
* 1 x Goblin Boss (MM 166) 15cp
* 1 x Bugbear (MM 33) 11gp
* 3 x Hobgoblin (MM 186) 14sp -- each

### Encounter 2 500 (84XP)
> The rest of your journey over the plains proceeds uneventfully as they slowly grow into hills, as these hills begin to transition into a small mountain range, your path leads you into a canyon, occupied by little more than a rushing river and narrow path. It is the first night since you've entered this canyon, the sun sets early and rises late in such a place, the safe thing to do is to make camp, light a fire, rest, and attempt to make up the time the next day, but there is the constant temptation to push on till all light has faded from the realm.

Creature List
* 10 x Giant Wolf Spider (MM 330) 1500 cp 


### Encounter 3 900 (150XP)
> As you pass under the gates you see a lone figure emerging out of the mist, you hear it shout something with a strained voice, barely audible over the short distance, it draws its sword and screams a war cry, a piercing sound from shredded lungs.

Creature List
* 1x Wight (MM 300) 20cp
* 4x Zombie (MM 316) 12gp -- each

We'll leave off here for the evening, you've entered the vcursed valley of ravenhead you see the stepped hills rising in the distance to the foot of the immense fortress

## The "Steps" of Ravenhead
Upon venturing the massive gates of Ravenhead the adventures see the "steps of ravenhead", the massive fields once green and fertile now overgrown rising up slowly to the base of a huge fortress in the distance.

### Encounter 1: Berry Bad Bushes
> After travelling a a fair distance you reach the first "step" that you have come to all day that doesn't look comepltely overgrown, spaced rather evenly upon it as far as you can see are small shrubs, maybe a little overgrown but not quite, berries of different kinds grow on each one ripe for the taking.
If the players pass through here without disturbing the shrubs I let them pass without knowing the bushes were alive.
If they decide to disturb the bushes in anyway bring them to life, the first shrub to be disturbed should probably get a surprise round as most likely someone will be pulling a berry off of it and getting a bushy slap to the face.

Creature List
* 5d6 x Awakened Shrub (MM) -- Maybe more I'm thinking this is between 5 and 10 rounds of combat

### Encounter 2

### Encounter 3

## Hall of Evil

### Door Puzzle
Unlock the door somehow, make it difficult so it seems like it was lasting, but easy enough they can open it, some kind of warning might be nice too



> A horrible smell assaults your senses as you enter the main hall of Ravenhead, the floors are littered with corpses and and rusted treasure, a faint glow comes from the other side of the of a giant set of doors at the other end of the hall.

> As you pass through this second set of doors, you lay your eyes upon a once glorious treasure hoard, now rusted and decayed, and the massive dragon skelteon that lays upon it. its flesh hanging from the bones like rags. 
> Stepping through the doors into the massive hall you hear a voice so loud it feels like it comes from inside your own head "Why have you desturbed me mortals? Turn back and leave this place, take nothing as you go, and I might take pity upon your poor souls".

If the players flee:
> And so you flee the evil at ravenhead, never to know the truth of what great power permiated the valley.

If the players stay:
> As you push forward you hear the voice again "Fools, you shall know death.", with this the dragon skelton on the mound of rotting treasure, lifts it's head and turn's its hollow eyes upon you.

#### Creature List
* 1 x Dracolich

## Resolution
> With the Dracolich defeated his horde is yours, the once magnificant treasure has decayed over time with exposure to the death laying over this place, but with effort you are able to scrape some worth.

#### Loot
* Something
